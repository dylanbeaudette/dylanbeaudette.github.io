The MV summary is a 2D representation of all the DEM / PRISM data. Imagine a 2D shadow of a complex 3D object.

From the summary, it would appear that (in multivariate space):

1. CyB (green) is fairly homogenous--the samples are clustered around a single centroid, the "+" symbol.

2. CwB (blue) is quite a bit different (distance in the figure is inversely proportional to "similarity") from the other two map units. It appears to have two closely related sub populations: e.g. the two blue curves. Investigation of the univariate summaries (bw and density plots) might help with interpretation. Could be a chunk of these map units occur at higher elevation than most of the others.

3. Crb (red) overlaps significantly with CyB (curves overlap and centroids are close). The lower, disconnected red curve suggests that within the collection of CyB there are some polygons with drastically different properties. Different from Crb, Cyb, and CwB. Worth investigating.

Some other notes:

* curves with smaller areas = lower variation
* overlap suggests shared ranges, see attached CA630: 7011, 7085, 7086
